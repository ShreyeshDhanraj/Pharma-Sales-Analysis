# Pharma-Sales-Analysis
Excited to share my new Power BI project: Pharma Sales Analysis

In this project, I explored pharma sales data and built interactive dashboards to deliver actionable business insights. The goal was to make complex sales data easy to understand and help decision-makers act faster.

The project includes three key reports:

Executive Summary Report :
A high-level view of overall sales performance, revenue trends, and key KPIs – helping stakeholders quickly track business health.

Distributor & Customer Analysis :
Deep dive into top distributors and customers. This analysis identifies the most valuable partners, customer buying patterns, and areas of growth opportunity.

Sales Team Performance :
Focused on sales representatives’ performance with KPIs such as targets vs. actuals, top performers, and areas that need attention – enabling fair evaluation and productivity improvement.

With these reports can:

Track sales growth effectively

Strengthen distributor and customer relationships

Improve sales team efficiency with data-driven insights

I really enjoyed working on this project, and it gave me a better understanding of how Power BI can turn raw data into meaningful business intelligence.
